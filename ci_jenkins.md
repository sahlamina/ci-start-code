# Jenkins
- Jenkins is an automation tool that uses java
- We want jenkins to run our tests automatically
- So we will link our git-hub to jenkins

- source -> build -> test -> production
- In order to enjoy CI, we need to make sure source code is functional
- Production is not a CI step, it is a part of CDelivery/Deployment
- Difference between Deployment/ Delivery is that when the code is being pushed, they push it to their own development branch
- Delivery - after test into production, we test manually
- Deployment - done automatically
- There is a code review prior to deployment too
