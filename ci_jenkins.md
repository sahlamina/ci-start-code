# Jenkins
- Jenkins is an automation tool that uses java
- We want jenkins to run our tests automatically
- So we will link our git-hub to jenkins

- source -> build -> test -> production
- In order to enjoy CI, we need to make sure source code is functional
- Production is not a CI step, it is a part of CDelivery/Deployment
- Difference between Deployment/ Delivery is that when the code is being pushed, they push it to their own development branch
- Delivery - done only if all tests are passed
- Deployment - done automatically
- There is a code review prior to deployment too
- Deployment is also known as Production, then it is deployed, it is called a release 

### SDLC
- Software development lifecycle
- 3 main stages before devops and CI/CD
- development happens seperately from the client and the 
- Problem with old SDLC method was that it was very slow. 
	- The risks of releaasing new software with bugs and errors was very high

### UAT 
- user acceptance testing
